# Reinforcement Learning Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the assignments that were a part of the reinforcement learning(RL) course in my master's. These assignments basically involved implementing RL algorithms using Python. The algorithms corresponding to each of the four assignments are as follows:

1. Multi-armed bandits
2. Monte Carlo and n-step bootstrapping methods
3. Semi-gradient n-step temporal-difference(TD) learning
4. n-step TD learning using eligibility traces and Monte Carlo policy gradient methods
